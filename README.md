# minecraft-ore-lamp
Arduino code to power a 3D printed lamp in the shape of a Minecraft ore block. Changes colors between Redstone, Emerald, Gold, Lapis Lazuli and Diamond (a final button push will turn it off). The design on Thingiverse only contained code for RGB LEDs. In case somebody wants to use Neopixel (WS2812B) LED instead, this code will work.
